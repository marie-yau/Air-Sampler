# Next-Generation Air Sampler Project

This project seeks to design a lightweight, programmable air sampler.

The sampler will be constructed on the
[Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)
platform.

The sampler will allow for the automated operation of an air pump and any number of three-way solenoids.

Its immediate use is for tracer gas experiments in which bags will be used to capture samples of air outdoors or in buildings.

The project is led in parts by Michael Sohn (Principal Investigator),
Woody Delp,
David Lorenzetti,
Randy Maddelena,
Marion Russell,
and
Marie Yau.

The project is supported in part by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
