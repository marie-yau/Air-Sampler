# Sampler setup

This folder contains instructions for setting up the hardware and software of the sampler. 

The instructions for the setup of the final version of the sampler are in the ```final_setup.md``` file. 

Previous prototypes included other Raspberry Pi modules and hardware that are not included in the final version of the sampler. Instructions for setup of these components are included in separate files for reference.
